## Studio 03 - Introduction to D3

This studio will walk through the process of creating data-driven shapes in the browser using [D3.js](https://d3js.org/), a powerful JavaScript library for visualization. 

### Files

### Preparation

#### Downloading a text editor

If you do not already have a favorite text editor, go ahead and download [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/).

#### Setting up a local server

To import external data, you will need to be able to serve files locally. Do this either by running Python's [SimpleHTTPServer](https://docs.python.org/2/library/simplehttpserver.html) (see [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7943751/what-is-the-python3-equivalent-of-python-m-simplehttpserver) StackOverflow question if you are using Python 3), or by downloading [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/).
