## Studio 02 - Generating an Editable Visualization Using NYC OpenData and RAWGraphs

This studio details the process of generating an editable, vector-based visualization using [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) and [RAWGraphs](http://rawgraphs.io/). RAWGraphs an open source framework developed by [DensityDesign Research Lab](http://www.densitydesign.org/).
