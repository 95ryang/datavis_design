## Studio 03 - Creating an Interactive Chart in Plot.ly

This studio walks through the process of creating an interactive chart in [Plot.ly](https://plot.ly/). Plot.ly is a visualization platform with libraries adapted to JavaScript, Python, R, and MATLAB. More recently, it supports the quick creation of web-based interactive graphs without using code. 

### Datasets
