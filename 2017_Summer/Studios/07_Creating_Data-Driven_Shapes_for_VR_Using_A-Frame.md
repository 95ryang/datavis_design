## Studio 07 - Creating Data-Driven Shapes for VR Using A-Frame

In this studio, we will be exploring the world of data-driven, VR-ready shapes using [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/). A-Frame is a web framework for building virtual reality experiences, viewable through VR headsets like [Google Cardboard](https://vr.google.com/cardboard/) and [Oculus Rift](https://www.oculus.com/rift/). We will first learn the basics of drawing 3-D primitives using the library, and then will progress to rendering the values of a simple CSV file as a series of geometric shapes. The purpose of this studio is to familiarize participants with VR technology and the basics of web development, while working with a familiar dataset generated from the previous week's studio.

### Datasets

We will be using the same class-generated dataset we used in the previous studio, this time in its static form.

* Random numbers - Available [here](https://github.com/emilyfuhrman/datavis_design/blob/master/2017_Summer/Data/07/class_dataset.csv)

### Glitch projects
