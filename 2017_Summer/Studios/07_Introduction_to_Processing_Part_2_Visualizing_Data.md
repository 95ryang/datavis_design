## Studio 07 - Introduction to Processing (Part II): Visualizing Data

_**This is Part II of a two-part tutorial. To view Part I, click [here](https://github.com/emilyfuhrman/datavis_design/blob/master/2017_Summer/Studios/06_Introduction_to_Processing_Part_1_Creating_Data-Driven_Shapes_Using_Processing.md).**_

[Processing](https://processing.org/) is a free and open source framework for visual coding. In this studio, after creating a series of data-driven shapes using a class-generated dataset, we will generate a series of random-number rows to compare our "random" data to randomized data (namely, the definition of "random" as defined by Processing itself). 

### Datasets

We will be using a class-generated dataset for our sketch:
