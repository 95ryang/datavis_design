## Studio 06 - Creating Data-Driven Shapes Using Processing

[Processing](https://processing.org/) is a free and open source framework for visual coding. In this studio, after reviewing the basics of computer drawing, we will be generating a simple dataset in class and using it to draw data-driven shapes that leverage Jacques Bertin's [visual variables](http://www.infovis-wiki.net/index.php?title=Visual_Variables). 

### Datasets

We will be using a class-generated dataset for our sketch:

* Random numbers - Available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14wucEu9-_HxpZTY3YM4hGUSQn8FlYYjwvpjeikHfcH8/edit#gid=0)

### Creating data-driven shapes
#### Generating data

* In class, navigate to the row in the spreadsheet that contains your UNI and enter a random **integer** in the `random_number` column. For the purposes of this Github walkthrough, I will assume this column to be populated.
* Once the column is populated, go to `File > Download as > Comma-separated values (.csv, current sheet)`. The current spreadsheet tab should download with a `.csv` extension.
