## Studio 07 - Creating Data-Driven Shapes for VR Using A-Frame

In this studio, we will be exploring the world of data-driven, VR-ready shapes using [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/). A-Frame is a web framework for building virtual reality experiences, viewable through VR headsets like [Google Cardboard](https://vr.google.com/cardboard/) and [Oculus Rift](https://www.oculus.com/rift/). We will first learn the basics of drawing 3-D primitives using the library, and then will progress to rendering the values of a simple CSV file as a series of geometric shapes. The purpose of this studio is to familiarize participants with VR technology and the basics of web development, while working with a familiar dataset generated from the previous week's studio.

### Glitch

We will be using [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) in this studio to facilitate the process of getting a web development environment up and running. Two projects exist for you to clone and edit:

* Getting started - Available [here](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/fir-airport)
* Visualizing data - Available [here](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/sage-branch)

### A-Frame basics

### Getting started

* Navigate to the "Getting started" project. Your window should look something like this:

* To see what we are working with, click the `Show [Live]` button at the top left corner of the window. In the new tab that opens, you should see a cube, a sphere, and a cylinder resting on a plane. Try clicking and dragging around your window to get a feel for the 3-D effects.
