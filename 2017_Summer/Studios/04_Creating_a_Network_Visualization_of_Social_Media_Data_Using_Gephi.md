## Studio 04 - Creating a Network Visualization of Social Media Data Using Gephi

This studio details the process of creating a customizable network visualization using [Gephi](https://gephi.org/users/download/). Gephi is a free and open source graph visualization platform, which can export to both a static SVG and an interactive HTML5 page. We will first walk through the process of importing and customizing a visualization of a simple dataset, originally culled from [this](http://www.briansarnacki.com/gephi-tutorial/) tutorial by Brian Sarnacki. We will next walk through the process of importing and customizing a more complex dataset containing social media data. Inspired by [this](http://www.martingrandjean.ch/introduction-to-network-visualization-gephi/) tutorial, which was originally put together by digital humanist Martin Grandjean, we will explore Gephi's network analysis capabilities and created a more intricate social network graph. 

### Datasets

We will be using three datasets for these visualizations (one for the first network, and two for the second):

* (Network 1) 1902 Banks and Bankers in Grand Rapids, MI - Available [here](https://github.com/emilyfuhrman/datavis_design/blob/master/2017_Summer/Data/04/01_1902_Banks_and_Bankers.csv)
* (Network 2) Twitter Connections (Edges) - Available [here](https://github.com/emilyfuhrman/datavis_design/blob/master/2017_Summer/Data/04/02_Twitter_Edges.csv)
* (Network 2) Twitter Connections (Nodes) - Available [here](https://github.com/emilyfuhrman/datavis_design/blob/master/2017_Summer/Data/04/02_Twitter_Nodes.csv)
