## Tutorial 01 - Creating a web map in CARTO
*This is a tutorial that builds upon [this](https://github.com/juanfrans-courses/mapping_arch_hum/blob/master/Fall_2016/Tutorials/07_Creating_Webmaps_Part_01.md) one, originally created by Juan Francisco Saldarriaga (jfs2118@columbia.edu) for the [Mapping for Architecture, Urbanism and the Humanities](https://github.com/juanfrans-courses/mapping_arch_hum) class at Columbia University*

This tutorial will walk you through the process of creating an interactive map in CARTO, a powerful platform for visualizing geographic data. 

### Datasets

We will be using one dataset for this map:

* PLUTO for Manhattan - Originally downloaded from [here](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/dwn-pluto-mappluto.page)

### Creating a building age map of Manhattan
#### Importing and loading your data into CARTO

* Once you've downloaded the data and created your CARTO account, log in into CARTO. You will land on your 'dashboard'.
